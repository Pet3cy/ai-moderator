      - Links to promotional websites
      - Short URL services used to hide destinations (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)
      - Links to cryptocurrency, gambling, or adult content
      - Links that don't relate to the repository or issue topic
      - Suspicious domains or newly registered domains
      - Links to download executables or suspicious files
